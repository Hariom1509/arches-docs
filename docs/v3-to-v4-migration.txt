Migrating Data from v3 to v4
############################

.. sidebar:: Terminology Note

    In v3 we had "resource graphs", while in v4 we call these "Resource Models". Conceptually they are the same. We'll be referring to them here as "v3 graphs" and "v4 graphs"/"Resource Models", respectively.

Upgrading your Arches installation is a complex process, as a significant backend redesign was implemented in v4. We have developed the following documentation (and the code to support it) to guide you through the process. You will be performing a combination of shell commands and basic file manipulation. 

Before migrating data, you'll need to install Arches 4 and make a new project. You can name your project whatever you want, but throughout this documentation we'll refer to it as ``my_project``. You can customize the templates and images in your project any time (before or after migrating the data). We recommend adding a Mapbox key so you can use the map for visual checks during the migration.

.. seealso::

    Refer to :ref:`Installation` and :ref:`Projects and Packages`.

Before moving on, you should be able to run the Django devserver from your project, and view it in a browser at http://localhost:8000.

Once you are ready, you can move on to exporting all of your legacy data from v3.

After you have all the v3 data exported, you are ready to follow the appropriate workflow for your deployment.

.. sidebar:: Which workflow should I use?

    If your v3 deployment of Arches was based on Arches-HIP, and you did not modify any of the graphs (but you did customize the RDM content), you can use the Arches-HIP Workflow. If you did modify some of the graph nodes (change their names, etc.), you can probably still use that workflow, but you'll need to edit the ``v3data/graph_data/...nodes_lookup.csv`` file for that graph.
