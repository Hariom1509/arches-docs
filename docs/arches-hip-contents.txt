What is Arches HIP?
===================

The Arches Heritage Inventory Package (HIP) is a data schema that was originally developed for `Historic Places L.A. <http://historicplacesla.org>`_, the Arches implementation in Los Angeles that was designed to hold data from the ongoing Survey LA project.

In Arches v4, the HIP takes the form of 6 Resource Models and 1 billion Branches. [pull quick description here from v3 docs].
