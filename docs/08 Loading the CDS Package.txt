Loading the CDS Package With Sample Data
========================================

Arches manages cultual heritage resources through the use of packages. A
package defines the types of resources that Arches should manage and the
resources' attributes. This can include things like the web based forms
neccessary to create and edit resources, reports, and services to
support search. In reality, though, it can include almost anything the
package developer wants to add into Arches.

You will need to load at least one Arches Package into your Arches
Server to begin managing a cultural heritage inventory. These are these
steps demonstrate the process for the CDS Package.

Step 1: Download the CDS Package
--------------------------------

Get a copy of the CDS package by going to the Packages section at
http://archesproject.org/download-arches/

Create a folder called "cds" in archesproject/packages and download the
code to that folder (unzip if neccesary)

I>you should have a directory structure simlar to this:

::

    archesproject/
        arches/
        ...
        packages/
            cds/
                install/
                media/
                models/
                ...
        settings.py

Step 2: Install the Package
---------------------------

Open the archesproject/settings.py in your favorite text editor.

Add an entry in the INSTALLED\_PACKAGES setting coresponding to the name
of the folder you created to hold the CDS Package in the packages
directory (following our example above, it would look like this)

::

        INSTALLED_PACKAGES = (
            # entries here should correspond to folders within the packages directory
            'cds',
        )

I> Don't forget the trailing comma for a single entry in a python tuple

If you don't want to load the test data that comes with the package,
open the package's settings.py file (don't confuse this with the Arches
settings.py file from above) and set **LOAD\_TEST\_DATA = False**

Open a command window, and navigate to:

::

    archesproject/build  

Run the following script to install the CDS package:

::

    install_packages.bat (on Windows)

    OR
    install_packages.sh (on Linux)

Congatulations! You've just completed the steps needed to install the
core Arches application and CDS package on your server. This package
comes loaded with sample data provided by English Heritage.

Loading the CDS Package With Your Own Data
==========================================

Remember, a package defines the available resource types and attributes
that you can use to describe resources within those types. What it does
not define is the content of the data itself. Therefore, it is possible
to "map" your own data into the resource types and attributes that are
defined in the CDS Package.

The button pushing for loading the package with your own data is
identical to the workflow described above. However, before you "Install
the Package", replace the content of the source data files with your own
custom content.

Note: If you do this *after* you "Install the Package," then your
changes will not be reflected in the Arches database. This must be done
*before* you install the package.

There are two types of source data files to concern yourself with in
this process 1. Authority Documents 2. resource\_info

Step 1: Modify Authority Documents
----------------------------------

The purpose and structure of authority documents are described in some
detail in Section 7 of this document. First and foremost, populate the
authority document files with the content that you wish to use for the
attributes that are constrained by controlled vocabularies.

If you want to do anything fancy with your controlled vocabularies like
associate them with geometries, add attributes supporting attributes to
them, or arrange them hierarchically, then take a very close look at
Chapter 7.

Step 2: Populate resource\_info
-------------------------------

The purpose and structure of resource\_info is described in some detail
in Section 7 of this document. The key points to remember as you
construct your resource\_info file are the following:

1. Make sure that the data in the attributename column is constrained to
   valid attributename values from "CDS attributes.csv". This file
   defines the set of resource types and attributes for given resource
   types within the CDS package.

2. Make sure that the attributevalue for any attributename ending with
   '.E55' is a valid conceptid as defined in one of the authority filesâ€¦
   that you ostensibly edited.

Be sure to read up on information from Chapter 7 describing the purpose
of resourceid, resourcetype, and groupid (especially groupid) columns
within the resource\_info file.

Step 3: Install the Package
---------------------------

Follow the direction outlined in Step 2 in the first workflow of this
chapter.

Lastly
^^^^^^

There may be a point at which the resource types and their respective
attributes do not sufficiently meet the business need that you are using
Arches to fulfill. That is the point when you need create or use a
differnt "package." See chapter XXX for guidance on defining and
building your own Arches package.
