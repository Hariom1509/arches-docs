System Requirements
===================

Arches works on Linux, Windows, or macOS. Most production implementations use Linux servers.

To begin development or make a test installation of Arches, you will need the following **minimum** resources:

:Disk Space: - **2GB** for all dependencies and Arches.
    - **8GB** to store uploaded files, database backups, etc.
    - Depending on how many uploaded files (images, 3d models, etc) you will have, you may need **much** more disk space. We advise an early evaulation of how much space you *think* you'll need, and then provision twice as much just to be safe...
:Memory (RAM):  - **4GB**
    - This recommendation is based on the fact that ElasticSearch requires 2GB to run, and as per `official ElasticSearch documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/heap-sizing.html#_give_less_than_half_your_memory_to_lucene>`_ no more than half of your system's memory should be dedicated to ElasticSearch.
    - In production, you may want to increase your memory, and allow ElasticSearch to use `up to 32GB <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/heap-sizing.html#compressed_oops>`_.

Software Dependencies
=====================


To familiarize yourself with the components and learn some important details, please
read the notes below. Where necessary, Windows installation notes are included as well.

:Python 3.7: - Installation: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - Python 3.7 and later comes with pip
    - **Windows** You must choose 32-bit or 64-bit Python based on your system architecture.
    - **macOS** This guide works well if you wish to install via `brew`: https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/
:PostgreSQL 12 with PostGIS 3: 
    - **macOS** Use `Postgres.app <http://postgresapp.com>`_.
    - **Windows** Use the `EnterpriseDB installers <https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/>`_, and use Stack Builder (included) to get PostGIS. After installation, add the following to your system's ``PATH`` environment variable: ``C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\bin``. Make sure you write down the password that you assign to the ``postgres`` user.
:Elasticsearch 7.4: - Installers: https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-7-4-0
    - Elasticsearch is integral to Arches and can be installed and configured many ways.
      For more information, see :ref:`Arches and Elasticsearch`.
:JDK 8: - `Only required to support a local installation of Elasticsearch`
    - `Installers <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>`_. 
    - **Windows** Once installed, find Java on your operating system, it will be somewhere like ``C:\Program Files\Java\jdk*.*.*_**``. Now take that full path, and add it to the ``JAVA_HOME`` system environment variable.
:GDAL > 1.11.5 and GEOS: - **Windows** Use the `OSGeo4W installer <https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/>`_, and choose to install the GDAL package (you don't need QGIS or GRASS). After installation, add ``C:\OSGeo4W64\bin`` to your system's ``PATH`` environment variable.
    - **macOS** Use version 3.6.1 (3.6.2 has caused trouble).
:Yarn: - Installation: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install
    - **Windows** Use the .msi installer in the link above, but first install `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/>`_.
:CouchDB 2.x: - Installation: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/index.html
    - `Only required to support Arches Collector Mobile app.`
    - CouchDB is used to sync mobile data collection projects with your main database. 
    - Arches will connect to CouchDB with default credentials. However, in production you must make a new CouchDB admin after installation, and then update ``COUCHDB_URL = 'http://admin:admin@localhost:5984`` in ``settings.py`` accordingly.
