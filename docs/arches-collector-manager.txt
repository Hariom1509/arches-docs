Arches Collector Manager
########################

In order to collect data in the field with the Arches Collector app, a system
admin must first design a "Project", using the Arches Collector Manager. A
project is defined by a number of parameters, and a single Arches instance can
can have as many active (or inactive) projects as you need.

To design a project, you should be first consider these questions:

+ Who?
    Which of your Arches database users will be participating? You can choose
    individual users, or groups of users.
+ What?
    For which of your resource models do you need to collect data? You can set
    a project to only collect data specific resource models, or for all of them.
    Also, will users be creating new resources, or updating existing ones? Or
    both?
+ Where?
    Will your users have a data cell connection? Will they need to work offline?
    Arches Mobile works in both cases, but an offline workflow has some extra
    considerations.
+ When?
    Each mobile survey has a duration during which data collection is allowed.

    If you haven't already, we recommend you read about `Arches Collector <using-arches-collector.html>`_
    before you create your first project.
