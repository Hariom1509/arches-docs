Creating a Form
###############

Now that you've configured the card, thereby defining how a user will enter information for each node, you are ready to put together the first Form.  A Form is just a collection of Cards, which allows you to group the data entry into themed sections.

1. From Manage..., choose Data Entry Forms to enter the Form Designer.
2. Click Add Form +
3. On the left hand, you'll see the Data Card Library, where all of the Cards available to you are listed. The central area will hold the Cards that you have selected for your form, and on the right are your new Form's settings. We'll begin by defining these settings.
4. In the Identifiers tab, set the Form Name to "Identification".
5. In the Icon tab, type "tag" to find the tag icon, and select it.
6. In the Status tab, make sure that the form is Visible and Active.
7. Click |save-edits-btn| to save your progress.
8. Now you just have to add the Card to the form. In the Data Card Library (left pane), you should see the Name Card. Drag it into the central area. If we had created more Branches, we'd be able to add their Cards to this Form as well.
Click |save-edits-btn| to finish your work on this form.

Even though we only have one Card at this point, and a very simple Identification Form, you should now see how easy it is to create and configure Forms. Note that if you have more than one card in your form, the order you set them in the central area will be the order they appear in the form.
