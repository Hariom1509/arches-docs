Introduction
============

Welcome to the **Arches Installation Guide**. This document is intended
to help you quickly get Arches running on your server.

What do I need to know to use this guide?
-----------------------------------------

Arches is designed to let you manage many types of cultural heritage
data. And while we've tried to make it easy to install Arches, you'll
need to make some decisions on how you wish to describe and manage the
information that goes into Arches. But don't worry, we've also included
lots of examples and well-thought-out defaults for setting up the
software.

So, installing Arches means loading software and deciding how you want
to describe the cultural heritage information that's important to you.
We've written this guide assuming that you are comfortable working with
your computer's command line, and that you can edit text files with
ease.

That's it! Feel free to tap a colleague on the shoulder if you need a
little help along the way, or check out the resources at
http://www.archesproject.org for more support.

System Requirements
===================

There are a few things to know about Arches before we get started.

Please note that Arches has been developed for modern browsers. It supports:

    * Firefox
    * Chrome
    * Safari
    * Opera
    * Internet Explorer 10 or higher.

Minimum system requirements:

    * At least 4GB of RAM for evaluation and testing, or 8 to 16GB for production.
    * 10GB minimum to install the code base and test dataset, but disk space requirements will vary greatly depending on the size of your dataset

It's important to recognize that Arches is designed to manage large,
enterprise-scale Cultural Heritage inventories. The software is
sophisticated and is designed to be support extensive customization.
This means that there are many ways to deploy Arches.

We've written this guide to streamline the installation of Arches Server
and the in the more straight-forward manner possible. These
installation instructions provide step-by-step guidelines for installing
Arches.


Dependencies
============

* PostgreSQL relational database (version 9.3)
* PostGIS (version 2.x) spatial module for PostgreSQL
* Python (version 2.7.6 - there seem to be issues with later versions of python) 
* GEOS

These instructions will provide some guidance on installing 
the required dependencies and getting Arches up and running quickly.

Installation
============

For the installation process you will need **pip** installed on your system. If you don't already have it, you can find instructions to install it here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html

Generally arches applications (in the case below 'my_arches_app') are installed in a project directory (in the case below 'Projects'). A virtual environment ('ENV') is created at the same directory as your arches application, so if you have multiple arches applications, they can share the same virtual environment.::

    /Projects
      /ENV (virtual environment where arches gets installed)
      /my_arches_app

With your Arches dependencies installed, you are now ready to install Arches. 

#.  Install virtualenv and create your Python virtual environment::

        $ pip install virtualenv

    .. note::
        Using apt-get to install virtualenv will install an older version that will result in errors in your Arches installation. Be sure to use pip for your virtualenv installation.

    virtualenv creates a directory with it's own installation of Python and Python executables. Arches will be installed within this virtual environment. To do so, navigate to your Projects directory (or wherever you want to create your arches applications) and create your virtual environment with the following command::

        $ virtualenv ENV

    Now activate your virtual environment with the following command:

    On Linux (and other POSIX systems)::

        $ source ENV/bin/activate

    On Windows::

        > \path\to\ENV\Scripts\activate

    .. note::
        If you are creating an Arches application based on HIP, you should stop here and go to: http://arches-hip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started/#installation.

#.  Install the arches module
    For this step your virtual environment must be activated. You will know that's the case if you see the name of your virtual environment in parentheses proceeding your command prompt like so ``(ENV)``::

        (ENV)$ pip install arches

#.  Create the Arches application scaffolding - in your Projects directory run the following command replacing ``my_arches_app`` with the name of your arches application::

        (ENV)$ arches-app create my_arches_app

#.  Install ElasticSearch
    Navigate to the directory containing manage.py::

      (ENV)$ cd my_arches_app/
      (ENV)$ python manage.py packages -o setup_elasticsearch

    Your project directory should now look something like this::

        /Projects
          /ENV (virtual environment where arches gets installed)
          /my_arches_app
            manage.py
            wsgi.py
            README.txt
            /my_hip_app
                settings.py
                setup.py
                urls.py
                /elasticsearch
                /logs
                /media
                /models
                /source_data
                /templates
                /tests
                /views

Settings
========

Open the settings.py file in my_arches_app/my_arches_app

There are a few changes that you may need to make in order for your application to install and run properly.

Be sure that the name of your postgis template in your settings matches your postgis template in PostgreSQL. If it doesn't, uncomment the line (remove the ``#`` at the start of each line) below and replace 'template_postgis_20' with the name of your template::

  #DATABASES['default']['POSTGIS_TEMPLATE'] = 'template_postgis_20' 

The default database password used in Arches is 'postgis'. You may have already set your PostgreSQL password to something more secure. If so, uncomment the line below and replace 'postgis' with your PostgreSQL connection password::

  #DATABASES['default']['PASSWORD'] = 'postgis'

Running Arches
==============

#.  **Start ElasticSearch**:

    Open a new command terminal and run the following command::

        $ /my_arches_app/my_arches_app/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.4.1/bin/elasticsearch

    You can minimize this terminal and let it run in the background


#.  **Create your database**:

    Using your first terminal::

        (ENV)$ python manage.py packages -o install

    .. note::

        This step will drop and recreate a database with your with the following name: arches_my_arches_app as well as load any concept schemes or business data that you may have defined in your settings.

    .. note::

        If you get the following error *'django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL:  database "arches_my_arches_app" does not exist'* It is probably because Arches is unable to find your postgis database template to create your new application's database. By default, Arches will look for a template called 'template_postgis_20'. If this does not match the name of your postgis template database, open your new applications settings.py file and define the name of your postgis template::

          DATABASES['default']['POSTGIS_TEMPLATE'] = 'the name of your postgis template' 

#.  **Run arches**:

    Open a new terminal. **Be sure to activate your virtual environment for this terminal as well**.

    Navigate to your application's ``manage.py`` file and run::

        (ENV)$ python manage.py runserver

    Now you can open a browser window and see your application running at::

        http://localhost:8000/

    .. note::

        We use the Django development server to make it easy for you to
        confirm that Arches has installed properly. You WILL NEED to configure
        Arches to use a production quality web server such as Apache if you want
        to use Arches in production.

Next steps:

Now that Arches is running, you will need to load your concept scheme and resource data.
