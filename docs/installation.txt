System Requirements
===================

Arches works on Linux, Windows, or Mac OSX, but some of its dependencies may be more difficult to install on certain operating systems. Most enterprise-level installations of Arches have been created on Linux servers.

To begin development or make a test installation of Arches, you will need the following:

+ **2gb disk space**
	+ 1.5gb for all dependencies (Postgres/PostGIS, Python, GEOS, etc.) and 300mb for Arches.
	+ In production, the amount of disk space you need will depend on the number of resources in your database, specifically uploaded images or media files.

+ **1gb memory (RAM)**
	
	+ In production, we advise 4-16gb of memory, primarily to support ElasticSearch.

*When viewing Arches, please note that it has been developed for modern browsers -- Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer (10 or higher), Safari, etc.*

Dependencies
============

* PostgreSQL relational database (version 9.5)
* PostGIS (version 2.x) spatial module for PostgreSQL
* Python (version 2.7.6 - there seem to be issues with later versions of python) 
* GEOS

These instructions will provide some guidance on installing 
the required dependencies and getting Arches up and running quickly.
